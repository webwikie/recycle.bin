Like the Apple's Trash application, the Recycle Bin is a location where deleted files or folders are temporarily stored in every version of Microsoft Windows since Windows 95. The Recycle Bin allows users to recover files that were deleted in Windows. It is on the desktop. The image is an example of what the Recycle Bin may look like in your version of Windows.
